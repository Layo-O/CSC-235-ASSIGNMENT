Program to test if a number is a self describing 

Declare self describing as integer
Declare numberofarray as char
Declare testcase as char
Declare lengthofnumber as interger
Declare counter as interger
Initialize counter as zero
Accept number to test and store in into a variable testcase
Check for the length of the testcase and store into lengthofnumber
Set loop on lengthofnumber, store loop testcase into numberofarray loop
Display numbers in numberofarray and testcase
Step a loop of m base on lengthofnumber
Set a loop of i base on lengthofnumber
Check if numberofarray loop i is equal to m
And if the condition is true, increment counter by 1
Check if counter is equal to numberofarray of loop m
And if the conditio is true testcase is a self describing number
Else testcase is not a self describing number
