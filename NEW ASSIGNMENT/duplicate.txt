Program to delete duplicate file 

Declare name_of_file as character array
Declare file_id as interger array
Declare compare_f as integer and initialize it as zero
Declare lowest_id as interger and initialize it as zero
Declare stepcount, number_file and t as interger
Accept number of steps and store in in stepcount
Set a FOR loop to count from 0 to the number of stepcount
Accept number of file to compare and store it in number_file
Declare j as interger and initialize it as zero
Set a while loop j which is less than number_file 
Accept name_of_file and file_id, store it in name_of_file of loop and file_id of loop j
increment j by 1
Store file_id with 0 to lowest_id
Set FOR loop of j less than number_file
Set FOR loop of i which is equal to j+1 and i less than number_file
compare name_of_file of loop j and i and store it in compare_f
Check if compare_f is equal to zero and lowest_id is greater than file_id of loop j
Store file_id of loop j into lowest_id
Check if compare_f is not equal to zero and file_id of loop j is greater tha file_id of loop if
Store file_id of loop j to test
Store file_id of loop i to file_id of loop j
Store t to file_id of loop i
Set FOR loop from zero to file_id
Check if compare_f is not equal to zero  
Display file_id of loop j
Check if compare_f is equal to zero 
Display the name_of_fileand file_id that won't be deleted
